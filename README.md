## Blog-Flasky
This is an interesting blog website, which is small but complete.
It has almost all the features, that a blog site should have.
Generally, there are seven major functional systems:
******
* User authentication system
* User roles and permissions
* User profile page
* Fine blog interface
* Users concerned about the system blog post
* Users' reviews
* Programming interface
******
Above it, I use python framework [flasky](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/),
 which depends on two external libraries: the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) template engine and the [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) WSGI toolkit
[This is my home page](www.zengliang.net.cn). Welcome to visit it. 
If you have any question, please feel free to contact [me](zengliangcs@gmail.com)
