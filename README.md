## Blog-Flasky
This is an interesting blog website, which is small but complete. The purpose of writing this blog website is to get my hands dirty and get familiar with the development process.
It has almost all the features, that a blog site should have.
Generally, there are seven major functional systems:
******
* User authentication system
* User roles and permissions
* User profile page
* Fine blog interface
* Users concerned about the system blog post
* Users' reviews
* Programming interface
******
Above it, I use python framework [flasky](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/),
 which depends on two external libraries: the [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) template engine and the [Werkzeug](http://werkzeug.pocoo.org/) WSGI toolkit.
